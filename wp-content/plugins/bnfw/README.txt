Supercharge your WordPress notifications using a WYSIWYG editor and shortcodes. Default and new notifications available. Add more power with Add-ons.

== Description ==

Better Notifications for WordPress is a simple but powerful plugin for beginners to advanced users that allows you to customise the email notifications that WordPress sends using the WYSIWYG editor and shortcodes. All of the default WordPress email notifications are available to customise as well as lots of new ones. You can choose to send notifications to individual users, multiple users, all users in a user role, multiple roles - you name it! You can also power-up your notifications with [Premium Add-ons](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/store/). Emails are sent out via your WordPress website (using `wp_mail`) but can be sent via SMTP using an appropriate 3rd party plugin should you wish.

Here's a quick walkthrough of the plugin in action: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxPUyRZPJ1Q

= An Example: =
You want all the users in the Editor role to be notified via email when a new post is published and you'd like to customise it to include your logo along with the author's name and date / time it was published - with this plugin, that's easy. 

> A handy list of shortcodes you can use is available [here](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/shortcodes/ "Shortcodes for use in Better Notifications for WordPress").

= Premium Add-ons =
Power-up your notifications using add-ons: 

[Conditional Notifications](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/downloads/conditional-notifications/) - Limit certain notifications depending on which categories, tags, post formats, or terms you choose.

[Custom Fields](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/downloads/custom-fields/) - Provides a number of new shortcodes allowing you to include data from custom fields and custom user fields created using [ACF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/).

[Send to Any Email](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/downloads/send-to-any-email/) - Send notifications to non-WordPress Users.

[Per-post Override](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/downloads/per-post-override/) - Override some of the settings of notifications directly when editing a post, page, or custom post type.

[Update Reminder](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/downloads/update-reminder/) - Send a reminder to your users and/or user roles when a post, page, or custom post type hasn't been updated in a certain number of days.

If you'd like to see a notification in the list above, please drop me a line in the forum and I'll see what I can do to add it.

> Like this plugin? Please leave it [a great review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bnfw/reviews/?rate=5#new-post)! Don't think the plugin is worthy of 5 stars? Having problems? Let me know in the [forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bnfw/) and I'll do my best to help.

> DISCLAIMER
> This is an incredibly useful and highly rated plugin however, it's possible that overuse or abuse of this plugin could upset your users by sending them too many notifications. By downloading / installing / using this plugin, you take full responsibility of the management / quantity / types of notifications that are sent out from it including abiding by any SPAM laws in your country / operating areas, dealing with / responding to subscription / unsubscription requests, complaints, and so on. I accept no liability or responsibility for SPAM or abuse of this plugin from the user(s) of or anyone that may receive notifications as a result of the use of this plugin. I'm trusting you, please don't abuse your users.



== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'bnfw' plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory or install it via your WordPress Admin.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the settings in the new 'Notifications' Menu item in the sidebar to configure the plugin.
4. (Optional) Install a plugin to use SMTP instead of `wp_mail()`. I recommend [Postman SMTP Mailer/Email Log](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/).
5. Test by creating a notification with some [shortcodes](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/shortcodes/ "Shortcodes for use in Better Notifications for WordPress").



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

> Full Documentation for BNFW can be found [here](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/documentation/ "Documentation for Better Notifications for WordPress").

= What are shortcodes? Where can I use them in this plugin? = 

Shortcodes are text in square brackets that output content of some kind. For example, if you want to add the content of a post to a notification for 'New Post Published', you can use the `[post_content]` shortcode to display this in the email that is sent out. 

Shortcodes can be used in the 'Subject' and 'Message Body' of your notifications, except for a select few (due to a restriction in WordPress).

> A handy list of shortcodes you can use is available [here](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/shortcodes/ "Shortcodes for use in Better Notifications for WordPress").

= What are some scenarios this plugin could be used for? =

* Outreach: A blog/news site with hundreds of subscribers and want to use it to alert them of new blog posts. 
* Communication: A small, internal WordPress site and use it to alert staff of new posts or comments.
* Monitor: A website for an awesome new product or service and use it for notifications of pingbacks and trackbacks.
* Security: To receive alerts of password reset requests and their corresponding user.

The possibilities are endless! 

= Does this plugin work with anti-spam plugins, such as Akismet? =

Yes! There is an option for suppressing comments marked as SPAM in the plugin settings.

= Does this plugin work with Multisite? =

Yes and no - some notifications work, others don't, and some are missing entirely. I do plan on adding full Multisite support at a later date however, this will be in the form of an add-on. 

= What isn't this plugin? =

It's not designed to send out newsletters. There is no send-this-out-on-this-date style functionality included. There are many other great plugins available that you could use for that instead. Additionally, users cannot currently unsubscribe automatically from notifications so you'll have to work out how you manage unsubscribers manually.

= How do I set-up WordPress to work with this plugin correctly? =

This will very much depend on what notifications you're using the plugin for. Out-of-the-box, this plugin works very well but there are a few tweaks that will ensure 100% compatibility. All the below points refer to this plugin: 

* If you want to use the new comment notifications in BNFW, you need to un-tick 'Email me whenever anyone posts a comment' and 'A comment is held for moderation' under Settings > Discussion. It's OK if you don't do this but you might receive WordPress's own email notifications along with the ones you've configure using BNFW. It also goes without saying that you need to enable comments for your posts if you want the email notifications to come through. 

* If you want to use the 'Comment Reply' transactional email, you need to ensure that comments are only set-up to be 2-levels deep. You can do this by going to Settings > Discussion and changing the option 'Enable threaded (nested) comments 'X' levels deep' to '2'. Please also ensure this option is ticked. 

= Notifications aren't coming through! =

First of all, follow [this article](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/how-can-i-receive-the-best-support/) about how to find out what might be causing the problem. Additionally, please take a look at [this help document](https://betternotificationsforwp.com/documentation/getting-started/how-to-improve-email-delivery/) to see how you might improve email delivery when using Better Notifications for WordPress.

Many hosts place a limit on the number of emails that can be sent out within an hour so this may also cause some delay in emails arriving. MailPoet has a fairly extensive list of hosts and their corresponding email rate limits that's worth checking out [here](https://support.mailpoet.com/knowledgebase/lists-of-hosts-and-their-sending-limits/). Alternatively, please check with your host directly to find out what your limit is. 

If you're still having problems, please drop me a line in the [Free Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bnfw) and I'll do my best to help. 

= Some of my shortcodes aren't working! =

It's possible you're inserting a shortcode into a notification that cannot use it. For example: the 'New Category' email notification cannot use any of the author or time shortcodes as WordPress only stores the category name, category slug and category description in the database by default. It's also worth checking the spelling and underscores in any shortcodes as well as if they are wrapped in square brackets `[]`.

= I press the 'Send Me a Test Email' button but nothing happens! =

Check that you've saved your notification first, then try again. It may take a second for the email to come through. Please also check your email SPAM filter.

= Other emails from WordPress / other plugins are being messed up! =

WordPress, by default, sends all emails in Plain Text. If you'd like to include code or use the WYSIWYG editor as part of Better Notifications for WordPress in your emails, you can change this to HTML using the global setting in Better Notification for WordPress. This can be found under the 'Notifications > Settings' screen. Changing this global email format setting will affect how all emails are sent out from WordPress however, so you may experience formatting issues with emails sent out from other plugins if you change the email format setting in this way. If you do, change this setting to Plain Text. You can also set the email format on a per-notification basis when setting-up a new Notification. The caveat is that WordPress will only either allow setting the email format globally (for all emails) or individually for anything that's non-transactional.

= Custom Post Type 'X' isn't showing in the list of available custom post types =

This is most likely because it's `public` setting is set to `false`. Try changing this and see if it shows up in the list. If the custom post type has been created by a plugin and is set to private (such as [TablePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/ "TablePress")), you'll need to get in touch with the plugin author to see if they'll consider changing it to public instead so that BNFW can send out notifications for it. 

= Can I translate this plugin? =

Yes, of course! The plugin is completely translation-friendly and if you send me your .po file, I'll make sure to include it in the plugin and credit you in the changelog.

= Will this plugin work with versions of WordPress less than 3.5? = 

An older version might work but this is untested. A lot of the newer features require WordPress 4.0 and above.

* Improved: Users were getting confused with the 'Welcome Email', thinking it operated like that in the 'SB Welcome Email Editor' plugin. The name of this notification has been changed from 'New User - Welcome Email' to 'New User - Post-registration Email' to help differentiate its functionality in BNFW.

= 1.3.8 - 16th December 2015 =

* Fixed: An issue where quotes in the Subject field were causing part of/all the field content to be removed.

* Fixed: An issue where the 'disabled wpautop' checkbox was appearing on transactional emails. 
* Fixed: Some labels in the 'All Notifications' screen weren't formatted correctly.

= 1.3.4 - 2nd October 2015 =

* New: You can now add images to your notifications using the 'Add Media' button above the WYSIWYG editor.
* New: Portuguese Brazil translation for v1.3.3 (props Glayton Caixeta).

* If you liked this plugin, please feel free to leave an honest [review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/bnfw?filter=5#postform). If you didn't or have a problem, please send me a message in the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bnfw).

= 1.3.3 - 22nd August 2015 =
* New: You can now send a notification to the Post Author only, where a notification supports it.
* New: There is now an option in the Settings screen to globally set WordPress to send emails in either HTML or Plain Text. Please read the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bnfw/faq/) for more information about this as there is a small caveat.
* New: Support for WordPress 4.3.
* New: Pending posts that are changed to Published now trigger the 'New Post / Page Notification'.
* Improved: Scheduled notifications now trigger two notifications, one for when they're saved as Scheduled ('Post Scheduled' / 'Page Scheduled') and one for when they're actually published ('New Post Published / New Page Published').
* Improved: Swapped the green tick for a dashicons tick for a slightly more speedier, native-feeling plugin.
* Improved: Reduced the flash of hidden elements when loading the New / Edit Notification screen.
* Fixed: WordPress 4.3 doesn't allow passwords to be automatically created for new users and will instead, send them to a password generator page. The `[password]` shortcode has been replaced with `[password_url]`. `[password]` should still work though so it won't break your existing notifications.
* Fixed: Some output was being showed when WP_DEBUG was enabled.
* Fixed: Removed the 'slug' field when enabled from Screen Options.

= 1.3.2 - 20th July 2015 =
* Fixed: Replaced a deprecated function which might cause a warning to show when `WP_DEBUG` was enabled.

* Fixed: The P2 theme wasn't triggering new post or comment notifications.

* New: Comment Reply Notification. This is a transactional notification that will only trigger when replying to the original comment (i.e. Up to 2-levels deep). 
* New: New Shortcode: Update Author. Use `[post_update_author]` in any Post or Page notifications to see which user updated the post. 
* New: Choose between sending the notification as plain text or HTML.
* New: A basic implementation of shortcode help has been added into the plugin. Click the link below the message body editor to see which shortcodes can be used for the currently selected notification.
* Improved: The 'New User Registration' (For Admin & User) and 'Welcome Email' notifications now allow you to use all of the 'User' shortcodes.
