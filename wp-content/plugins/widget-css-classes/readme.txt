Add custom classes and ids plus first, last, even, odd, and numbered classes to your widgets.

== Description ==

### Widget CSS Classes gives you the ability to add custom classes and ids to your WordPress widgets ###

_Please note that this plugin doesn't enable you to enter custom CSS. You'll need to edit your theme's style.css or add another
 plugin that allows you to input custom CSS._

__This plugin also adds additional classes to widgets to help you style them easier:__

* widget-first: added to the first widget in a sidebar
* widget-last: added to the last widget in a sidebar
* widget-odd: added to odd numbered widgets in a sidebar
* widget-even: added to even numbered widgets in a sidebar
* widget-#: added to every widget, such as widget-1, widget-2

__Features:__

* Adds a text field to a widget for defining a class
* You can specify multiple classes by putting a space between them
* Optionally adds checkboxes with predefined classes
* Optionally adds a text field to add an id to a widget
* Adds first and last classes to the first and last widget instances in a sidebar
* Adds even/odd classes to widgets
* Adds number classes to widgets
* Fully translatable
* Multi-site compatible
* Compatible with Widget Logic, Widget Context, and WP Page Widget plugins
* Has filters and hooks for customizing output including class names

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder _/widget-css-classes/_ to the _/wp-content/plugins/_ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the __Plugins__ menu in WordPress
3. Configure the settings under __Settings > Widget CSS Classes__
4. Visit __Appearance > Widgets__ to add or change the custom classes and ids for a widget.
5. Expand the appropriate widget in the desired sidebar.
6. You'll see a field labeled __CSS Class__. Depending on your settings, this will be a text field and/or checkboxes.
7. If you are using the text field you can enter multiple class names by separating them with a space.
8. If you've enabled the id field, you will see a text field called __CSS ID__.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't the classes showing up in my widget? =
You need to make sure you have an HTML element defined for `before_widget` and `after_widget` in your active theme's `register_sidebar` functions,
usually located in your theme's functions.php (_/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/functions.php_).

This HTML element must have class and id attributes. This plugin will not work if `before_widget` and `after_widget` are blank.

Example:
`register_sidebar( array(
	'name'          => 'Sidebar',
	'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
	'after_widget'  => '</div>',
	'before_title'  => '<h2 class="widget-title">',
	'after_title'   => '</h2>'
) );`

= How do I add the CSS for my custom class? =
There are two ways:

1. Edit your theme's style.css file (usually located in _/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/_).

2. Use a plugin such as [Simple Custom CSS](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/).

= How I export the Settings? =
You can export the Settings from __Settings > Widget CSS Classes > Import/Export__.
